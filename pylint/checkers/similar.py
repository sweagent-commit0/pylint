"""A similarities / code duplication command line tool and pylint checker.

The algorithm is based on comparing the hash value of n successive lines of a file.
First the files are read and any line that doesn't fulfill requirement are removed
(comments, docstrings...)

Those stripped lines are stored in the LineSet class which gives access to them.
Then each index of the stripped lines collection is associated with the hash of n
successive entries of the stripped lines starting at the current index (n is the
minimum common lines option).

The common hashes between both linesets are then looked for. If there are matches, then
the match indices in both linesets are stored and associated with the corresponding
couples (start line number/end line number) in both files.

This association is then post-processed to handle the case of successive matches. For
example if the minimum common lines setting is set to four, then the hashes are
computed with four lines. If one of match indices couple (12, 34) is the
successor of another one (11, 33) then it means that there are in fact five lines which
are common.

Once post-processed the values of association table are the result looked for, i.e.
start and end lines numbers of common lines in both files.
